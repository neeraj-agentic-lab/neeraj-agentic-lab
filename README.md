## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in designing and delivering **enterprise-grade, AI-powered commerce platforms** by combining **Commerce Systems, Cloud Infrastructure, and Agentic AI**.

With 20+ years in digital platforms, I’ve:
- Delivered **60+ global B2C & B2B digital platforms**
- Built and scaled **20+ products** driving multi-billion-dollar revenue
- Led **0 → 1 innovation** and **enterprise-scale modernization**
- Operated across **product strategy, architecture, and hands-on execution**

My current focus is **Agentic Commerce** — where LLM-powered agents reason, plan, and act across end-to-end commerce workflows.
